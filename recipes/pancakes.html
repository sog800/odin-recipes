        <h2>Sheet Pan Buttermilk Pancakes</h2>
        <p>
            Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy 
            <br> mornings or breakfast meal prep. The buttermilk makes these baked
            <br> pancakes light, fluffy, and oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan
            <br> pancake recipe can be easily customized by adding your favorite fruit
            <br> or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before cooking.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>3 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick®)</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                <br> Line a sheet pan (approx. 13 x18 inches) or jelly roll pan
                <br> (12x17 inches) with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with 
                <br> cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and
                <br> cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well
                <br> combined, but don't overmix. Pour batter onto the parchment
                <br> paper-lined pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper with the pancake
                <br> from the pan and set it onto a cutting board. Slice the pancake sheet
                <br> into squares using a pizza cutter or into your desired shapes
                <br> with a cookie cutter.
            </li>
        </ol>
