        <p>

            <strong> Cook's Note: </strong><br>
            <em>The salsa I used is a roasted Carolina reaper salsa, and is hotter than most salsa. If you're using a mild salsa, <br>
                 adjust accordingly.
            </em>

            <li>1 ¼ cups self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon carne asada seasoning (such as Lawry's®)</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Colby cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salsa</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon</li>
            <li>green onions for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                 <br> Spray a sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
                 <li>Mix Greek yogurt, flour, and carne asada seasoning
                   <br> together in a medium bowl until a shaggy dough forms. 
                  <br> Transfer to a surface dusted with self-rising flour, and knead for 
                   <br> about 5 minutes until smooth. Continue adding flour as needed if 
                   <br> the dough is too sticky.</li>
                   <li>
                        Knead dough for about 5 minutes until smooth.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                        Shape dough to fit into sheet pan.
                   </li>
                   <li>Bake dough in the preheated oven for 12 minutes.</li>
                   <li>Meanwhile, stir together eggs, cheese, hash browns, and salsa in a bowl.</li>
                   <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat,
                    <br> turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 7 minutes.
                    <br> Remove bacon to a drip line tray. Let cool before roughly chopped
                    <br> bacon.</li>
                    <li>
                        Pour egg mixture over dough. Sprinkle bacon over the top.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook until eggs are set, about 25 minutes. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove from oven and top with chopped green onions. Allow to cool slightly
                        <br> before serving.
                    </li>
            </ol>
