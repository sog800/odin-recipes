        <h2>Lemon Chicken Romano</h2>
        <p>Every Monday, our team meets and takes a look back at the week prior 
           <br> to see what caught the eyes and ears of our audience. Last week,
          <br>  one recipe blew all others out of the water. Its traffic eclipsed 
         <br> not only the other recipes but also every other new article published. 
         <br> what was behind all that buzz? A weeknight winner, chicken dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this delicious lemon chicken romano recipe,
            <br> chicken cutlets are crusted with Pecorino Romano cheese and
            <br> panko bread crumbs and accented with fresh lemon zest.

            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>3/2 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chapped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>4 large lemon wadges</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with <br>
                 parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lightly season each side of the chicken with salt and pepper. Add flour to a <br>
                shallow dish. Whisk eggs and water together in a second dish. Combine panko bread crumbs, <br>
                Romano cheese, lemon zest, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a third shallow dish..
            </li>
            <li>
                Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then dredge each chicken cutlet in the flour, <br>
                shaking off excess. Dip cutlets into the egg wash, allowing excess to drip off, and, <br>
                finally, dredge in the bread crumbs, pressing down on each side so breading stick
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add breaded <br>
                chicken cutlets and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is crispy and starts to <br>
                turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip cutlets, and cook for another 2 <br>
                minutes
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer cutlets to the baking sheet, and evenly sprinkle each with mozzarella <br>
                cheese
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run <br>
                clear, 6 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center <br>
                should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Do not overcook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven, garnish with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges for <br>
                spritzing.
            </li>

        </ol>
